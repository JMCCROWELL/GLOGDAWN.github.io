## **Stepping Razor**

You’re the Hero; the Protagonist; World’s Greatest Swordsman. Or maybe you’re the Razor Girl; nerves set to overdrive with fingers full of blades waiting to be used. Whoever you are, you’re a student in the nearly lost art of Ass Kicking, always on the lookout to fight someone bigger and badder than you, until you prove yourself a master. 

You gain +1 HP for every Stepping Razor template you possess.  

Starting Gear: Leather_Jacket(light, 2), Katana (mm, d8, 0, Weeb) ×2, Uzi (mr, 1d8, 5, One_Handed)

Starting Skills: [1] - Stepping Razor, [2] - Soldier, [3] - Gang Tactics



1. Combat Expert, +1 Attack
2. Trophy
3. Signature Weapon, +1 Attack
4. Armed Shield, Unstoppable

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Combat Expert</span>**

You gain +2 to Combat Maneuver rolls. Further, if you get exactly the number you need during an attack roll, make an opposed attribute check as you would during a Combat Maneuver. On a success, you make a free Combat Maneuver. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Trophy</span>**

You collect trophies from high status opponents you defeat; be it a hachimaki of a rival bosozoku leader or a scrap of cloth barring a Corporate logo taken from a former security guard Captain - as long as it is possible for someone to identify and realize that they associate with the trophy. You gain a +1 Attack against those sorts of people. These bonuses stack, though after a while the bosozoku should run out 

of people. The trophies also make negotiations with that group more difficult. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Signature Weapon</span>**

Choose a weapon you’ve used before. You gain +2 to Attack when using that weapon. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Armed Shield</span>**

On a successful Grapple Maneuver against a target with a ranged weapon, you may make a free attack action against any other target, at a -2 attack modifier, using the grappled target’s weapon. Additionally, any attack made against you while the grapple is held, gets redirected to the grappled target.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Unstoppable</span>**

When you fell an opponent down to 0HP with an attack, you gain a free attack action with the same weapon.
