## **Fixer**

You’re a professional middle man. When people need to find information or a special something, they come to you. When people are in need of buyers or to have a body go missing, they come to you. Making arrangements between the two parties is your forte. To you, information is just as good as currency, as it will certainly be worth something. 

You gain +1 Contact with every Fixer template taken.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Well Connected</span>**

When attempting to hire hirelings, treat your charisma score as 2 higher. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Well Prepared</span>**

When in a shady back alley, you may spend any amount of money to receive an unmarked box. When opened, you declare what’s inside, as long as the item(s) are equal or lesser in value than what you paid, and use the correct amount of inventory slots. It is possible to have a smaller box within a box. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Done your homework</span>**

Any very specific detail you learn about your next job adds a point into a special conviction point pool. This pool is usable by the team, may only contain up to the fixer level's worth points, and these points are only good for the specific job.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Line of Credit</span>**

You’re known for being good to your word. Where most illicit dealings require money up front, usually in a nice briefcase or other easily verifiable form, people who have heard of you or dealt with you before are willing to extend up to 250,000 units of standard currency (nuyen, bitcoin, dollars, whatever). Mind you this is total, be it across multiple dealers or all with one. Regular repayments are expected, with rather unfriendly results should you seem to be neglecting said payments. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I Remember Reading About That</span>**

Once per day, you may treat your Intelligence as being 20, for the purposes of knowledge related skill checks. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I Know A Guy</span>**

Once per session you can call in a favor owed you by someone within your network of contacts, with a 5-in-6 chance of them willing to accept without payment.
