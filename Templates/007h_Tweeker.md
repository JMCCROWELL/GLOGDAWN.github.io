## **Tweeker**

Put simply, you’re a man that enjoys a chemical dependency. Doesn’t matter what it is: HyperCocaine, Synthohol, or Crystal Pepsi. You indulge nearly constantly and have a tendency to lose yourself to the whims of the drug. 

You can ignore +1 points of Intoxication for every Tweeker template you take. 

Starting Equipment: AR-15 (mr, 1d8, 6), Old_Bat(mm, d8, 0, Concussion), 1d4 doses of your drug. 

Starting skill: [1] - Streetwise, [2] - Chemistry, [3] - Medical Centers



1. Drug Fueled Rage
2. Twitchy, Dependant
3. Drug Resistance
4. Becoming the Drug, Burn Out

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Drug Fueled Rage</span>**

By taking a large dosage of your drug of choice, you may enter a drug fueled rage for 4 + {Template] rounds. While enraged you are immune to pain and fear, and gain +1 to your attack and defense. You do, however, lose yourself to the drug. Any action described as “defensive”, “curative”, “cooperative”, or “tactical” is not one your drug-addled mind can comprehend. The drug says FIGHT, so you fight. Using technology any more complicated than a gun, or a weapon implant, is right out. While you won’t target your friends, anyone that harms you (accidental or otherwise) in this fight ain’t a friend until the rage ends. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Twitchy</span>**

The drug has left your nerves a complete mess. When surprised, you have a 3-in-6 chance to act on the surprise round anyway. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dependant</span>**

Keep those eyes open. Taking a dose of your chosen drug adds 1d4 in temporary HP lasting as long as the drug effects. Stackable up to your level (i.e. 3 doses for 3d4 at level 3)

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Drug Resistance</span>**

When in the midst of your Drug Fueled Rage, should you take damage greater than half your remaining HP, you may spend a Conviction point to ignore it

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Becoming the Drug</span>**

You’ve entered a new state in your drug habit: A toxic zen. Replace the bonuses from your drug fueled rage with your level. This activates Dependant for free. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Burn Out</span>**

Your heavy drug usage has ruined your nervous system, dulling your connection with the world. All incoming damage is reduced by 2 points, even when you’re sober.
