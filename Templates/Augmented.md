## **Augmented**

You’re someone, who be it through a violent life or merely idle boredom, has replaced a portion of their original body with high tech augmentations. Whether you’re “More machine than man” or “More human than human” you’re definitely an improvement over the original human body. 

For every Augment template you take, gain 1 Augment Package, detailed further at the end of the Augment section.

A. Headspace <br>
B. Encryption <br>
C. Submerge <br>
D. Ghost in the Machine <br>

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Headspace</span>**

You have a Head Drive. It’s free. It’s yours. Additionally, the various processors of your augments work more efficiently, giving you +2 storage space per Augmented Template you take. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Encryption</span>**

Unwanted access to your Head Drive is harder. You gain +4 in your Saves vs. Hacking on top of whatever Counter Intrusion programs you’re carrying in your head. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Submerge</span>**

Entering into a digital metaphor, you are able to share data files in your Head Drive with other submerged Augments instantly.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ghost in the Machine</span>**

Upon becoming fully dead, lose half your levels and rewrite as AI at the new level. You retain all knowledge and digital holdings you had when you were alive.
