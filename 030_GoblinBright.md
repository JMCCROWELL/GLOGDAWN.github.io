Wanting something more cyberfantasy rather then cyberpunk, but finding Shadowrun too much of a hassle? Fair. And to that I offer: GoblinBright

# GoblinBright

Originally based on the perfect movie Bright, staring William Smith in a modern fantasy world where, despite notible significant changes in history, everything is exactly the same, it eventually drifted into Shadowrun material. 


Luckily, because Some Weird Sin is built on the GLoG chassis, bringing in fantasy aspects to your cyberpunk game/setting is incredibly easy. The rules are almost exactly the same; just find a template you like and slap it in. Provided is some material specifically made for the cyberfantasy setting of GoblinBright.
