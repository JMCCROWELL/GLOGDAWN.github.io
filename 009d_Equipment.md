_Boosters_ (₽1000) - Like the satellite uplink, but terrestrial. Receives any incoming signal and repeats it, effectively boosting coverage area. 

_Commlink_ (₽1000) - Life in 20XX is built around these.

Buy yours now, and be sure to pick up the latest attachments today! (Commlink accessories are typically compatible with cyberdecks.)
