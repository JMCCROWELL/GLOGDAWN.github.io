# **Drugs**

	

The potions of cyberpunk. Chemical cocktails cooked up in laboratories of various qualities. Some have standard delivery forms (alcohol, cigarettes) while others are left vague with no description. In this day and age of chemical synthesis forms are easily enough altered and alternative delivery methods can be found. 

If a drug or alcohol is labeled as “addictive” a Wisdom check must be performed with each dosage used. Any accompanying number (ie “Additive(2)”) serves as a penalty to the check. Failure indicates an addiction has been formed and without regular doses the character suffers the listed Withdrawal effects. 

Breaking an addiction takes about 21 days in real life, apparently. What that means mechanically is that for every day you don’t use the substance, roll a d20. If you roll equal or under your days clean, the addiction is broken and you no longer suffer the Withdrawal effects.
