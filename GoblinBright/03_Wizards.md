As you level, you will gain spells from your school’s spell list. You still can learn and cast spells from outside your school, but until you cast them 8 times, MD spent on them do only return on a 1, rather than a 1-3.

**Wizard Toolkit** <br>
You are a spellcaster. As such, you are afforded a collection of abilities:
1.  _**Cast Magic**_ - What would be the point if you couldn't cast magic? You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Spell Slot for each Wizard template you possess, to a maximum of 4 each, as shown in the Template list above.
2.  _**Magic School**_ - Select a Magic School. This will determine your Perk and Drawback, as well as your Spell List and any variations your specific school may have. If you're looking to play a generic wizard, simply select Universalist as your school. This school can not be changed later. 
3. _**Detect Magic**_ - The ability to detect magic is a Wisdom based skill for you. 


**Book Casting** <br>
You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before initiatives are rolled for the turn.You automatically go last in the initiative round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

**Friendly Spell** <br>
Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a positive mutation to the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests that you do.

**Master of Magics** <br>
Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new spell (GM’s discretion).
