The good thing about working on a semi-standard chassis like the GLoG, is that additional templates can be scrapped from external resources and adapted to the system with little work. And, boy, howdy...there's a lot of them. My [blog](https://wayspell.blogspot.com) has a few links to some of them, /r/glog on that particular garbage site will lead you to a few others. 

Wizards are listed in a seperate category, as there are many variations and indenting so much is not visually pleasing. Also they've their own can of worms that need to be explained (such as learning spells) so look for them there. 

Additionally, the following is a list of classes that may work well within the setting, made by other folks (all listed without permission): 

[Chainsaw Wizard](https://modronrpgs.blogspot.com/2021/08/you-exude-cosmic-darkness-glog-class.html) <br>
[Radical Catgirl Anarchist](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/10/radical-catgirl-anarchist.html) <br>
[The Crew](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/08/osr-glog-pirate-classes.html) - With a little adjusting, could easily be "The Gang" <br> 
[Wrench Wench and Big Bot](https://solaris242.blogspot.com/2020/10/glog-class-wrench-wench-and-big-bot.html) <br>
