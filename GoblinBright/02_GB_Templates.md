The good thing about working on a semi-standard chassis like the GLoG, is that additional templates can be scrapped from external resources and adapted to the system with little work. And, boy, howdy...there's a lot of them. My [blog](https://wayspell.blogspot.com) has a few links to some of them, /r/glog on that particular garbage site will lead you to a few others. 

Notably, my idea for Wizards is slightly different than other's, but there is zero reason you can't use your preferred version instead.
