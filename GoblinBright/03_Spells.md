# Spells

Originally, I was looking to convert the core book spells to GLoG versions, but god damn they're not great. And I enjoy the game. There's 18 versions of the same spell. Eighteen. Then there's spells for boosting a resist before you ingest a toxin and boosting a resist after you ingest the toxin. Why? They're the same spell, just casted at a different time. I mean, I've half assed writing assignments and used meaningless filler text in order to reach a certain word number length, but that wasn't for something getting published. I don't know. 

Some of these spells may seem over powered. That's fine. I want you to be tempted to use them; invest all your casting dice. Triples aren't THAT likely. (heh heh heh)

**New Mechanic: Mixed Success**

Casting dice are invested normally, however only the highest result is considered. More dice invested, higher chance of a better result. Doubles and triples still apply.



* 1-3: Mixed Success
* 4-5: Full Success
* 6:    Critical Success

**New Mechanic: Burnt Dice**

By voluntarily sacrificing a Casting dice, you can occasionally augment a spell in a way detailed.  Burnt dice do not return to your hand (nor are they rolled) until you normally replenish them. 


## Combat Spells

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**(Element) Ball**</span> <br>
**R: 200'  T: 20' area  D: Instant** <br>
You hurl a magical bolt of a chosen element at an area, doing **[sum]** damage to all objects. Elements to choose from: Acid, Electrical, Fire, Force, Ice, Radiation, Stun. Each element is a different spell and must be learned separately. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to allow for 1 ricochet per burnt dice. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to allow for a delay in explosion equal to the rolled value of the burnt dice in rounds. 

_Yep, that's it. That's the entire original Combat Spells section summed up into one spell. Saved ya two pages. Even spiced it up a bit._


## Detection Spells

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Analyze**</span> <br>
**R: 50'  T: Individual/Object  D: Concentration** <br>
The spell allows you to analyze the target of the spell, gaining some insight about it. Some appropriate targets are (but not limited to) devices, magical objects, people, or the words they're currently speaking. <br>

     Mixed Success - Vague details only

     Full Success - Vague details with minor specific details

     Critical Success -  Exact, specific details of everything detected

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Clairsavoir**</span> <br>
**R: [dice] * 10'  T: Point in Space  D: Concentration** <br>
You conjure an invisible sensor to a point in space, whether you can see it or not. As long as you can maintain concentration you're able to see through this sensor as if it was part of your normal sensory range. Unless you're blind, then you gain normal vision. Using an item as focus for the scrying (mirror, fire, bowl of water, etc) increases the range to **[dice]** miles. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to allow for an additional sense to the sensor: hearing, speaking, smelling

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Combat Sense**</span> <br>
**R: Self  T: Individual  D: Scene** <br>
Target has a **[dice]**-in-6 chance of still acting when surprised. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Detect**</span> <br>
**R: 500'  T: Self  D: Concentration** <br>
Six different spells, learned individually. Detects the presence of a type (see below) and provides some details of the detected. Casting dice are invested normally, however only the highest result counts for result. 

Types
* **Enemies** - Those that currently seek to do you harm. <br>
* **Individual** - A specific person, chosen during casting. 
* **Life** - Living things. Not spirits, nor robots. 
* **Life Form** - All of a specific type of life form (human, elf, dog, etc); target named while casting. 
* **Magic** - Detects all spells, artifacts, casters, spirits, etc. 
* **Object** - Detects a specific type of object (guns, explosives, spoons, etc); target named while casting. 

     Mixed Success - Vague details only

     Full Success - Vague details with minor specific details

     Critical Success -  Exact, specific details of everything detected

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Mindlink**</span> <br>
**R: 100'  T: Individual  D: [sum] minutes** <br>
Allows mental communication between the caster and the target, allowing for exchange of conversation, emotions, and mental images. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to add an additional target to the conversation. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Mind Probe**</span> <br>
**R: 20'  T: Individual  D: Concentration** <br>
Sometimes talking is too slow, and you need to pry the answers out of the target and move on. Target is very much aware of the probe, but not  necessarily the source.

     Mixed Success - You can only read the target's surface thoughts

     Full Success - You can find out anything the target consciously knows and view recent memories.

     Critical Success - You can probe their subconscious, gaining information the target might not be aware they have

     Mixed Success - Ends the side effects, but addiction remains. 

     Full Success - Ends the side effects and removes any addiction. 

     Critical Success -  As above, but makes target immune to the drug for [sum] day. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Heal**</span><br>

## Illusion Spells

Argh. Good lord. There's three spells in this section spread across...Jesus, nineteen. Gonna trim some fat here. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Disguise**</span><br>
**R: Touch  T: Object  D: [dice] hour**<br>
You wrap an object in a veil of illusion, allowing it to appear as another object of the same sort and size. You know, "disguise" it. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Hallucinations**</span><br>
**R: 50'  T: [dice] * 5' diameter  D: Concentration**<br>
You create a perfect representation of whatever object or creature you wish, in **one** of the traditional senses. This recreation is able to move or sound or smell however you determine, as long as you concentrate. This spell can only 'add', not 'subtract'. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to add an additional sense to the hallucination. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Obfuscation** </span><br>
**R: 50'  T: [dice] * 5' diameter  D: Concentration**<br>
Where the Hallucination spell adds, Obfuscation subtracts - removing an object/person from sight, muting a sound, destinking a stank. As long as you concentrate. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to cloak an additional sense


## Manipulation Spells

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Animate**</span><br>
**R: Touch  T: Object  D: [sum] minutes**<br>
Gives inanimate objects the horrific ability to move on their own. Target objects effectively become 1HD creatures with the intelligence of a trained dog. A dumb one. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to animate an extra object. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Armor**</span><br>
**R: 50'  T: Individual  D: Concentration**<br>
You solidify a field of magic around the target, adding [dice] to the target's armor score and taking up the same amount of inventory slots. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Barrier**</span><br>
**R: 50'  T: Area  D: Concentration**<br>
Actually two spells which are learned separately: One for magic, one for physical. You generate a translucent, but shimmering, wall with 10 square feet of surface area per **[dice]**, shapeable by you, that is one inch thick. A Physical Barrier stops physical things like bullets, cars, fleeing bystanders; while a Magic Barrier will stop anything with a magical aspect. If you think it has a magical aspect, it probably does.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Command**</span><br>
**R: Hearing  T: Individual  D: [dice] rounds**<br>
Target saves or obeys a **[sum]** word command.<br>
**[Burn]** a dice to extend the duration for rest of the scene. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to effect an additional target. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**(Element) Wall**</span><br>
**R: 50'  T: Area  D: [dice] rounds**<br>
See those elements listed in (Element) Ball? Now you can apply them in a **[Sum]** square foot wall. Apropos of nothing, a sheet is just a wall laying down. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Yeet**</span><br>
**R: 50'  T: Object  D: Instant**<br>
Flings an unattended target object at a secondary target. Weight of the object effected and damage done determined based on success: 

     Mixed Success - Up to 20 lbs (9kg). Damage as light melee weapon. 

     Full Success - Up to 200 lbs (90kg). Damage as medium melee weapon.  

     Critical Success -  Up to 2000 lbs (900kg). Damage as heavy melee weapon. 

**[Bring]** the GM a beer to effect animals/people. <br>
**[Burn]** a dice to change the Duration to "Concentration" to levitate the object instead. 


## Counterspelling and Dispelling

They're basically the same thing. Counterspelling is done while the spell is being cast (automatically failing your next Initiative check), where as Dispelling is performed while the spell is being sustained. The process is simple, but horribly dangerous, as the counterspeller vomits out a bunch of random magic energy in the hopes of something else happening. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Counterspell**</span><br>
**[Burn]** dice in an attempt to cancel out the target's MD rolled. The caster's higher roll cancels out the target's lower roll. Should any MD from both sides match, both the caster and the target suffer the Mishap effects. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Dispelling**</span><br>
**[Burn]** dice to attempt to unravel the delicate magics sustaining a spell. By vomiting on it. With magic.

     Mixed Success - The effect is reduced by [Burn] or [Sum] as appropriate, with Doom

     Full Success - The effect is reduced by [Burn] or [Sum] as appropriate, with Mishap

     Critical Success -  The effect is completely ended.
