# Metatypes

In ~~Shadowrun~~ Bright, if you wanna play a metahuman (them's your demihumans), you gotta spend character creation points to pick up the metatype. Well, there ain't no points here. In the GLoG you're human unless you take another species template at level 1. Here's no different. Below is the Bane and Bonus gained from the racial Template A.

You may notice the flavoring is different here. That's 'cause the only difference between Human and Metatype in ~~Shadowrun~~ Bright is some stat bonuses and the occasional ability to see in the dark. Not exactly thrilling stuff. Yes, yes, in the grand scheme of the corporate machines we're all the same; human, elf, dwarf - all just drones to turn a profit for the CEOs. But there's also blood magic, and Chicago has been nuked, so you might as well spruce things up a bit.

Though, if you want to use the ability bonuses and boring sight modifiers, I can't stop you. Only judge.


## Elves

You're a member of a lesser Physical offshoot of the race that constantly sings reality into existence. You were born and have lived your entire life in the Physical, and are probably doomed to become a corporate cog. Some of you have set up shop in British Columbia, screaming about Tir Na nOg and full ascension into the True world - but those are just fever dreams, hardly different from Smith and his Eden. ...or is it?

**Bonus**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Farstep</span>: You're able to slip briefly into the True World, in all of it's Dimethyltryptamine soaked, fractal-hell glory. Once per session you can slip through the cracks in reality and find a "short cut." Teleport 5*(level) feet in any single direction.

&lt;Sidebar>

If you're looking to actually make this closer to Bright, for some reason, replace **Farstep** with **Smell Magic**. It's like detect magic, but scent based. I recall them elves in the moving picture doing **a lot** of sniffing around potentially magical things.

&lt;/Sidebar> 

**Bane**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Radbane</span>: You're Physical, but are still affected by incorrect lyrics in the True World. As such, you suffer twice the damage done by radiation attacks. You also have a 1-in-6 chance of suffering an immediate mutation from the radiation.


## Dwarf

The elves refer to your people as "maggots." Rightfully, you're offended, but, also, in the previous age your people spontaneously generated from the body of a dead giant. But not just any giant, **The** Giant: Ymir. So, there's that. While your people were, and are again, accused of inflicting mental diseases on people, this isn't exactly true. The best you can do is drunkenness, really.

**Bonus**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blood of Brimir</span>: Once per day you can force a target to make a Save vs Mind Effect. Failure means they assume your level of Drunkenness, until healed normally.

**Bane**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bone of Blainn</span>: You're heavier than you look, as your bones are laced with iron, to the point of your Movement speed is reduced by 4.

Also, no matter what language you speak, and no matter where you were born, you speak in a thick German accent. Scientists don't know why. I don't either.


## Orc

Your folk were once humans - specifically French/Spanish Cagots from the Pyrenees - but at some point in the timeline of things, a BBEG needed an army, useful pawns, and/or general servants. A series of empty promises, cruel magics, and hogsheads of strange alchemical cocktails later the orc was born. Born? Crafted. Designed for war and war byproducts, Orcs tend to be harder than average to kill, fighting long after mortal wounds should have claimed them. After the BBEG's plans fell to ruin, Orcs faced a difficult reintegration into human society and - who am I kidding? Humans are shit, they still face a difficult reintegration, centuries later. 

**Bonus**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hard to Kill</span>: When at 0 HP or below, you may spend a Conviction point to ignore Lethal damage for 1d6 rounds. 

**Bane**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Won't Back Down</span>: A successful Wisdom check is required in order to retreat from a fight you've been injured in. 


## Troll

While Elves, Dwarves, and Ork can potentially blend in to a crowd of humans, you, yourself, are a big hulking form of a man. Well, not a man, exactly, no. Man-like, rather. With green fur and a large nose, you look like something that crawled out of a John Bauer picture.

**Bonus**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Troll Skin</span>: Restore 1 HP per round. Fire damage stops this effect, until a long rest, where it's heavily implied you've cut away the burnt sections and allowed your body to regrow.

**Bane**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Troll Metabolism</span>: You require double the dosage of consumables to have ANY effect when applied to your person. Also, because your body repairs so quickly, it will reject any Augment without a steady dose of immunosuppressant. The medicine also stops your Troll Skin from working while it is in your system.
