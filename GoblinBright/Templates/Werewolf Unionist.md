A. Beast Mode; Collective Action				

B. Don't Mourn, Organize!

C. Monstrous Transformation

D. The old John Henry 

**Beast Mode**

With a moment of concentration you can shed off the trappings and burdens inherent in being human and embrace the freedoms of being a wolf. You are able to transform into a dire wolf while retaining human reasoning, with all that that implies. 

**Collective Action**

While Conviction is typically gained by putting yourself in trouble, your Conviction can also be gained by successfully convincing someone to join a trade union. 

**Don't Mourn, Organize!**

After seeing a member of your party die of lethal damage, a successful Wisdom check restores half of your total hit points and all uses of per day abilities. 

**Monstrous Transformation**

You've gained further control over your form changing abilities and can now shift into a horrendous combination of were and wolf. While in this form gain a claw attack (as heavy melee), implied wolf abilities, +2 strength, and Damage Reduction 3. Being successfully attacked with silver ends the damage reduction effect until a long rest. Holding this form hurts like hell, however, and inflicts 1 non-reductable damage per round. 

Anyone bitten by you doesn't necessarily become a lycanthrope (assuming they survive) but they do slowly develop pro-worker ideal. 

**The old John Henry** 

Once per session, when in a contested roll with a machine (before rolling), you may simply announce that you pass the test and beat the machine.
