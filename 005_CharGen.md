# **Character Generation**

Now that the brass tacks are out of the way, it’s time to get to making a character. It’s fairly easy and quick, done through the following steps:



1. Roll your stats. 4d4 in order. 
2. Roll for your Failed Career. Gain the Failed Career as a skill, and the listed items. 
3. Choose your first Template. Gain the A abilities, skill, and listed items. 
4. Take another skill of your choosing.
5. Gain the starting items below. 
6. Roll your starting cash (1d3 x ₽1000) and purchase additional gear from the Gear section. Pocket any extra cash. 


## **Starting Items**

Starting players are assumed to have the following, in conjunction with other Character Generated items:



* Commlink
* Credit Chip
* 3 clips of ammo for starting weapons
* Lower class living space

Obviously, the last one doesn’t take up inventory space. 


## **Leveling Up**

Leveling up is based on the sort of jobs you do, the number of jobs you do, and the Street Cred generated from doing such jobs. Enough Street Cred and you’ll find yourself in a tougher world, doing harder jobs. You got this though. When you earn a certain amount of Street Cred (detailed on the chart) you gain a level. 

Whenever a character levels, increase their HP, Attack, and Save based on their new level, per the chart. Additionally, a player may increase a stat of their choosing. Simply declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, increase the stat by 1.
