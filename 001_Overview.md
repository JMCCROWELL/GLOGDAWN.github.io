# **Overview**

GLoGDAWN is based on Arnold K.’s “Goblin Laws of Gaming” homebrew system, also known as the GLoG. Original game rules and content can be found at goblinpunch.blogspot.com.

It is also inspired by the game Earthdawn, most recently printed in its fourth edition from FASA Games in 2015. 


## **It's a Magical World**

It is said that history is like a tapestry being woven by the fates. A Pattern. Each life is a thread in the age lace of the world. Here is a part of this story: 

Two-hundred years ago, the world was one of magical advancement. The problems of privation had been conquered. It was connected by sky ships. Though no one would call it "peaceful," magic filled the world, allowing people to grow and prosper.

Then, the Horrors came. They wiggled out of hell realms during a brief confluence where this world and the far planes came into contact.

The dwarves warned the world, and gave them the means to survive: *caerns*. Magical vaults, below the surface of the earth. 

Some escaped. Many died. 

Today, the Horrors have departed - the brief period where there was enough mana to survive has passed. So they say, anyway.

You and your companions have struggled free from your caern and found the world broken apart.

Now, stride forward into this new earth, into this new dawn, and make a legend of yourself!


### **Legend**

You are an adept. A student of the art magic. Your practice, be it through the expressions of your body, your song, your skysailing, or your command of aether, is magical. As an adept, you are important to the Pattern.

The more that you accomplish in the world, the more threads of the Pattern are tied to you. As your Legend grows, the more threads warp and weave as you grow near. 



At each level you gain an additional template (up to a max of 4) and the accompanying abilities, in addition to the base character listed above. You can also test a single stat of your choosing to see if it improves. To do so, roll 3d6. If it is equal-or-higher than the current stat, it improves by 1. 

At level 4 a character has access to their full array of abilities, and is considered “fully trained”. 

Gaining abilities past 4th level is done in one of two ways:



1. Cash - It’s the future of the 80’s where money rules everything. For the right price, you can purchase augments and upgrade your body. 
2. Surviving weird shit - Survive a blast from an experimental phase-shifter cannon from a zaibatsu science technician? Well, now you can force your way through solid materials. 

Alternatively, anytime you gain a new level at 5th or higher, you've the option to retire your character in safety - out of the reach of the GM. Characters retired before level 5 may return as macguffins or NPCs, their lives fully susceptible to loss or betrayal. 




## **Let's Go Exploring**

As adepts, when you have **time**, **skill**, and **gear**, you can accomplish most anything.[^1]
- If you have all **three**, you do not need to roll – you just succeed.
- Generally, if you have **none** or **one** of the **three**, a task is **impossible**.
- If you only have **two**, the GM will ask you to make a **check**, with time or your gear being at stake if you fail.

When you perform a **check**, the GM calls for you to roll one of your **attribute dice**. Attribute dice has 5 ranks: d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12.

If you roll a 4+ on your attribute dice, you succeed.

If you have situational bonuses or penalties, you step your dice up or down one step. Attribute dice can never go lower than d4 nor higher than d12. The target number to roll is always a 4, though.

### **Attributes**

Adepts have six attributes which represent their physical and mental prowess. Each attribute has a **rank** (a descriptive word that allows you to think about their attribute relative to others) and a **attribute dice** (a specific dice type you roll when the GM calls for a check). The average person has a d6 in all of their attributes. (Many starting adepts will be like this!)

When determining your attribute rank, we've provided some example words, but feel free to choose your own if you prefer it. 

_Strength_: Tested when you attempt feats of Strength: Shoving, climbing, forcing open doors, etc. Effects the number of items you can carry. 

d4 - Weak
d6 - Svelte
d8 - Athletic
d10 - Mighty
d12 - Titanic

_Dexterity_: Tested when trying to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate operations under pressure. Half of your Dexterity is the number of “Quick Inventory” items you can have. 

d4 - Clumsy
d6 - Adroit
d8 - Nimble
d10 - Graceful
d12 - Swift

_Constitution_: Tested when trying to resist disease, drowning, radiation, and the like. Your hit points are based on your Constitution and level. 

d4 - Frail
d6 - Brave
d8 - Sturdy
d10 - Robust
d12 - Unbreakable

_Intelligence_: Tested when asking esoteric questions about the world. Also determines the number of skills you can have. 

d4 - Uneducated
d6 - Informed
d8 - Well-Read
d10 - Learned
d12 - Expert

_Wisdom_: Tested when attempting to discern lies, spot hidden dangers, and to resist mind altering effects. It also determines your initiative. You’ll test initiative every round of combat to see if you act before or after opponents. 

d4 - Slow
d6 - Sensible
d8 - Intuitive
d10 - Keen
d12 - Savant

_Charisma_: Test to flatter or beguile. While social interaction is done at the table, potential edge cases are determined via Charisma test. It also affects the number of Hirelings you can manage. 

d4 - Coarse
d6 - Likable
d8 - Charming
d10 - Alluring
d12 - Bewitching



## **Other Numbers**

These are basically sub-stats. Listed are their primary modifiers, however Templates, Augments, and Gear may potentially modify them as well. See these particular sections for more details. 

_Attack_: Starts at 11, and increases with level per the chart. Roll under Attack, modified by the target's Defense, to hit. 

_Defense_: Starts at 10, modified by Armor. Light Armor is +2, Medium armor is +4, Heavy Armor is +6. Shields offer +1. Roll under Defense, modified by target’s Attack, to defend. 

_Initiative_: Starts at Wisdom and is modified by Templates, Augments, and/or Gear. Written separately here as a quick reference. 

_Movement_: Starts at 12. Determines how far you can move (about 60’; 5’ per 1 Movement), and is used in a contested test to safely disengage with an enemy in melee. Affected by Armor (-0 for Light Armor, -2 for Medium Armor, -4 for Heavy Armor) 

_Save_: Starts at 5 and increases with Level. If an attack or challenge doesn’t fall neatly, or agreeably, under any other stat or value, roll Save. It represents the character’s luck and ability to spit in the face of Fate. 

_Stealth_: Starts at 5 and acts as a penalty to opponents Wisdom to notice you. Affected by Armor (-0/-2/-4), Encumbrance, and environment. 


## **Conviction**

This life you’ve found yourself in is out right dangerous, more so given the world you live in. The lifestyle is often uncomfortable, morally questioning, and did I mention dangerous? No one takes it up without a good reason. All the better to stay a corporate cog, consuming mindless entertainment and corn-based substances. But not for you. You long for something better, something meaningful. You’ve been cursed with Conviction. 

Not everyone has Conviction, especially these days, but Player Characters always do. A Conviction is your character’s answer to one of these questions:



* Why did I start this lifestyle?
* What am I willing to risk my life for?
* What principles will guide my actions?

There are two blank spots on your character sheet for Convictions. You can fill these in whenever you want. Have a clear picture of the character when you start? Fill them in. Not sure about who your character is? Play them for a bit, get the feel of them, and fill it in when their Convictions reveal themself to you. However, you can’t gain or spend Conviction points until you have at least one Conviction. 

A Conviction might be “Find my brother.” Or “Bring down Marcone.” Shoot, even “Sup, girl?” can be a Conviction. 

You gain Conviction points whenever following a Conviction gets you into trouble. Or, at least, when following the Conviction is not an optimal strategy, yet you follow it anyway. If you leave a crime boss for the cops instead of putting a bullet in his because you have the Conviction of “Due Process,” knowing full well he can send goons after you from prison, take a Conviction point. You’re doing what you know to be Right, not easy. 

Conviction Points can be spent to get a bonus on a d20 roll. 



* If the roll is related to a Conviction: +8
* If the roll is unrelated to a Conviction: +4

You can only receive the large bonus if the roll is related to your Conviction. If your Conviction is “Find my brother” and the action leads you closer to finding said wayward brother, take a +8. However, if you need some help dealing with an Everglades methgator, you’ll get the +4. 

Typically, characters can only have 1 point of Conviction at a time. Some Templates may modify this. 


## **Skills**

Skills are just a word that describes something your character knows how to do. If you can convince the GM the skill applies for a test, you take a +2 bonus.

You start off with three skills, determined by your Failed Career, your level 1 Template, and 1 of your choosing. These include non-native languages. 

You may have a total of 3+(Int/4) skills. 

Skills cannot be used directly in combat.
